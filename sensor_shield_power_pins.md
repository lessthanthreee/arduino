Note: The power rail is usually on the edge of the board.
Look for pins marked with "5V" - there are typically multiple 5V pins available.

The 5V pins are typically:
1. On the power rail (edge of the board)
2. Usually marked with "5V" or "VCC"
3. There are multiple 5V pins - you can use any of them
4. They're often paired with GND pins

Can you see these pins on your Sensor Shield? They should be clearly marked on the board.
